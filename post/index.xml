      <description>This was part of a personal project where a python price scrapper was built in order to track prices for specific items on amazon and then send out email alerts. The way the model works is you add a link to the amazon product and the price you&amp;rsquo;re willing to buy the product at (Target Price) and then you can run the script and it will refresh the script every 24 hours and check the price for the product, as soon as the price of the product reaches your target price the scrapper will send you an email alert.</description>

      <description>This project was part of my Youtube channel where I build a yahoo finance web-scrapper to get stock prices from yahoo finance, This project was inspired as I was actively investing in the stock market and needed to automate the process to get and analyse data faster for various companies. The yahoo fin package help solves that huddle as it allow to automate the process through a script written in python.</description>
